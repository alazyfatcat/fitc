# Session title: From milisecond to million: Powering the web performance
The session is about the performance of websites. To be honest I didn't know much about the web performance. I heard about it while being in Social Media class learning about SEO
,so that is the first time I heard the term Web Performance. To my knowledge, I understand that it is about how well the website perform. It is fast or slow or smooth or maybe
not working functionally. So I hope I will have a deeper understanding about this term after this session. It could be a career path option to consider.

# The importance of Web Performance to business 
  Businesses financially tends to care about web performance way more serious than design system because web performance effect the bottom line immediately. Design system can
  save millions of dollars but web performance can save them time of years and you can make money within hours with web performance if doing it right so clients really care about it.
  
# The important of asking the right questions. 
    Lean on client as much as possible to do the right work and get better goal.
    ## How do you know the site is slow? If the client says they feels slow, it is the client emotional, you are likely to have a lot of works.
    If the client says 90% users say it slow then you probably have a client who understands their problem
    
    ## What key areas of the sire should I look at? Harry had to look every page and the lesson here is ask client for specific. Ask them what important
    part needs to be faster: product detail page, search engine or something. This will save a lot of time. 
    
    ## What will it being faster mean for the business? Determine the meaning of having a fast website to the client's company. Fast website doesn't make benefit for company.
    Company like Amazon needs their website to be fast because people are buying products on their website, the faster the web works, the more benefits they make. 
    
    ## How do you intend to measure this? Harry Robert measure miliseconds but what your client wants? 1 seconds faster or 2 seconds faster or 3 times faster? 
    Focus on the needs of client
    
    ## Faster website is just one factor of a good performance web besides user friendly, working functionally, it has to be a part of the big picture. 
  
#  Improve the speed of web running but still keep same number of ads 
   Some customers need to keep the same amount of ads or even add more ads. In this case, a Web performance engineer has to find the intersection between 
   ads, engagement and revenue since if ads raise will lead to the decrease in engagement and revenue.
  
# You can't fix what you can't measure 

  ## Gather data 
  Gathering data  is the most important work. "Spend time gathering statistics then spend some more". It is never too much data.
    ### Google Analytics is the most common tool but not ideal
      ⋅⋅* It gives average data means but we want percentiles 
      ⋅⋅* It only samples 1% of sessions and that is insufficient for many sites
      ⋅⋅* It is too coarse. it gives total data on every device, browser, page, region
      ⋅⋅* After every inconvenience, it is better than none. Use it if you have no other choice. 
                    
# If there is a lot of traffics to the website, it means there will be more data to work with, bigger range and finally leads to the slow of the website.
    
# Data is treasure when work with Web Performance

# Move slow to move fast 
  The more digging data at beginning, the quicker the rest project goes. Takes time to collect the data before jump into the project, that will saves a lot of time.
  
  ## Only release one thematic per day. By doing that, you will know which one works, which still needs improvement and which to fix.
  
 # What has most impact 
    After knowing which one works or doesn't, you will know where to look next time and what to avoid next time. This saves you time for the next project.

# Final reflections: I can apply all the process to my code learning process. Take time slow, learn step by step, do research before coding. I also have a more clear vision 
of the problems I could have in the future. 
# Questions I still have regarding that topic: How do I get into this career?
